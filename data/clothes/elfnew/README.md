Elf Warrior clothes made for average male..   I have added an Anisotropic texture for the Metal parts under optional displacement texture as the realistic metal look can only be achieved in blender if you select the vertices in edit mode and set that material to anisotropic then plug in the anisotropic texture as color.  if you dont do this then you will have matte white texture.

EDIT: I Re-exported this and all seems to be working now.
